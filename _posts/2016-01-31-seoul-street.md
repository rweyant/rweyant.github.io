This place has some of the best wings I've ever had.  These are not your traditional buffalo style wings, Seoul Street makes Korean Fried Chicken, using either Hot and Spicy or Soy Garlic sauce.  Both are fantastic.  The spicy wings are just hot enough to keep it interesting, but not so much to overwhelm.  The soy garlic sauce is just a perfect mix of flavors.

The best thing about these wings is how big and meaty they are.  These aren't the scrawny, piddling wings you get at B Dubs.  These are huge, thickly breaded beasts that will leave you satiated.  All of their food is cooked to order, so call ahead.  It's always worth the wait.

<br>

The Kimchee Fries also need to be mentioned.  These guys are an absolute must for every order.  Crispy fries loaded with kimchee, cheese, mayo and probably some other deliciousness.  You can add bacon, egg, tofu on top; it's amazing.

The fried veggies are also pretty good, but we usually fill up on wings and fries.
