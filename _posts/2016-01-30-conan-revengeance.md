## Conan - Revengeance (2016)

This album is just awesome.  I've been a huge Conan fan from the start, and this album does not disappoint.  

<br>

It starts out a little faster than Conan's usual slow, plodding pace, but has plenty of that brutal, doomy, heaviness we've come to expect from Conan.  Happy to see that Conan kept with the tradition of barbaric metal song names, too.  

<br>

My favorite track is probably Earthenguard, for obvious reasons.  This song is just so heavy, slow and goes on for almost 12 minutes! It pretty much exhibits everything I love about Conan.
