## Conan - Revengeance

This album is just awesome.  I've been a huge Conan fan from the start, and this album does not disappoint.  

<br>

It starts out a little faster than Conan's usual slow, plodding pace, but has plenty of that brutal, doomy, heaviness we've come to expect from Conan.  Conan keeps with the tradition of barbaric metal song names.  

<br>

My favorite track is probably Wrath Gauntlet.  This song is just so heavy, slow and goes on for almost 9 minutes! It pretty much exhibits everything I love about Conan.
