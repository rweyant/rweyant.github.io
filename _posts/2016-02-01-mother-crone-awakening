## Mother Crone - Awakening (2015)

<br>

This album is just amazing. I don't even know what I was expecting, but by the time Descending to the North came on I was hooked.  It's heavy, proggy, has elements of thrash, doom, the works. Black Sea was a little thrashier, but I was still digging it.  This album is solid all the way through.  The title track is last and super heavy, catchy and long.  Super excited to hear more from these guys.
